You can read more about my project [here](https://hackaday.io/project/162946-esp32-reflow-oven) at Hackaday.io . :slightly_smiling_face:

This repository contain firmware and 3D files for ESP32 reflow controller. 

All version of controller include:

- ESP32 module
- 2.8" TFT LCD (ILI9341)
- MAX31856 IC for measuring temperature
- SD card slot
- buzzer
- USB to UART converter
- USB connector
- 5 buttons (Left, Right, Up, Down, Select)
- status LED 

### There are these revision of the board:

- **rev. A**

First version of the board. Fully working, except buzzer. 

- **rev. B**

Second version of the board. Reworked buzzer and changed for SMD version.

- **rev. C**

This board include 2 more buttons (Menu & Back button), fan connector, Reset button and USB-C connector.

Board dimensions are 105 x 51 mm.

### There are 2 version of firmware for this board:

- **V1**

Basic functionality. One working profile which can be start/stoped.
**Not developed anymore.**

- **V2** (**recommended**)

You will need these libraries to compile FW from source code: 

 - Adafruit_ILI9341 (v. 1.5.1 in Library Manager) 
 - Adafruit_MAX31856 (v. 1.0.3 in Library Manager)
 - Adafruit_GFX (v. 1.7.2 in Library Manager)
 - ArduinoJson (v. 6.13.0 in Library Manager)
 - PID (v. 1.2.0 in Library Manager)
 - WiFiManager (https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager/tree/development)- install it in IDE from ZIP file
 

#### This firmware include following:

- [x] OTA update.
- [x] Vertical/Horizontal mode.
- [x] WiFiManager - you can setup your WiFi network for OTA updates. When not setup, it will start in AP mode and create network with SSID **ReflowOvenAP**. Setup server can be access at IP address: **192.168.4.1**, after connecting to this AP.  

Planned features:

- [ ] Reflow profiles (via JSON file)
- [ ] Web server for remote change of the settings 

This firmware include Menu, which can be open by pressing **Menu** button (**Left** button on rev. **A&B**). Here you can change items in **Settings**. This firmware still contain one hardcoded profile.

Firmware is based on Rocket Scream Electronics firmware for [Reflow Oven Shield](https://www.rocketscream.com/blog/2012/11/28/updated-back-in-stock-reflow-oven-shield-controller/)

Some parts of the V2 firmware are inspired by parts of <a href="https://github.com/UnexpectedMaker/ReflowMaster" target="_blank">Reflow Master</a> firmware by @UnexpectedMaker
